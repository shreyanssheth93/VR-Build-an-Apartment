Some Try and Errors (Feedback):

--> So i kept the Baked resolution to 5 and tested on 80 Lightmap Resolution it took a lot time to generate the light map and APK. But it worked well in my Mobile Phone.
--> I want to know what is use of lightmap and why we changed directional mode to non-directional mode?
--> I was having problem with putting up lights and I want to know how area lights work actually?
--> I learned many new things about unity 3D placing and lights and animation controller. i would like to learn more how we can animate in animation graph.
--> Everything was pretty easy but i was struggling with lights so i want to learn and get good grip in that too.
--> I also added a new animation which look like 3D text with using animation properties. But why do we make all lines linear in curves graph in animation panel?
